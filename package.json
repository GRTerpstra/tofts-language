    "start:about": "The ts-node library enables you to directly execute TypeScript on Node.js without precompiling",
    "build:compile:about": "Babel transpiles TypeScript and compiles it into backward-compatible JavaScript. Build into the lib folder because this project is a library. Usually the dist folder is for shipping an UMD that a user can use if they aren't using package management, and the lib folder is what the package.json main field should points to. Users that install the package using npm will consume what the main field points to directly.",
    "build:types:about": "TypeScript does the type checking (with tsc (the npx command is used because tsc can't be added as devDependency)) and the .d.ts file generation.",
    "files:about": "The files field is an array of file patterns that describes the entries to be included when your package is installed as a dependency. File patterns follow a similar syntax to .npmignore, but reversed (whitelist instead of blacklist). You can still blacklist files and folders by placing '!' in front of them",
    "comments:about": "npm removed my duplicate comment properties so all comments are in one field."
